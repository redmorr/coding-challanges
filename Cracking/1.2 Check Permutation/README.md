# 1.2 Check Permutation
Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

**Details:**
- Is it case sensitive?
- Do whitespaces matter?

**Solutions:**
1. Sort the strings.
2. Check if the two strings have identical character counts.

The second, a more efficient solution was implemented.
